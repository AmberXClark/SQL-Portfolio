----For this project, I performed analytics on a dataset I downloaded called chinook.
--The dataset represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. 

--Showed Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != "USA";

--Showed only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

--Found the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
SELECT FirstName, LastName, customers.CustomerId, Country, InvoiceId, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers
JOIN chinook.invoices
ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

--Showed the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT LastName, FirstName, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";

--Found a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

--Provided a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, invoiceid
FROM chinook.customers
JOIN chinook.invoices 
ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees
ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId;

--Showed the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT (Invoice_Items.UnitPrice * Invoice_Items.Quantity) AS Total, Customers.FirstName AS CusotomerFirst, Customers.LastName AS CustomerLAST, Invoices.BillingCountry, Employees.FirstName AS SalesAgentFirst, Employees.LastName AS SalesAgentLast
FROM Invoice_Items
JOIN Invoices
ON Invoice_Items.InvoiceId = Invoices.InvoiceId
JOIN Customers
ON Invoices.CustomerId = Customers.CustomerId
JOIN Employees
ON Customers.SupportRepId = Employees.EmployeeId;

-- Showed how many Invoices there were in 2009
SELECT COUNT(Invoices.InvoiceId)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE Invoices.InvoiceDate LIKE "%2009%";

--Showed the total sales for 2009
SELECT SUM(Invoice_items.Quantity * Invoice_Items.UnitPrice)
FROM invoice_items
JOIN invoices
ON invoice_items.InvoiceId = invoices.InvoiceId
HAVING invoices.InvoiceDate LIKE "%2009%";
